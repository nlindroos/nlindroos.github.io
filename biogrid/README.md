# Biogrid

An Angular application displaying photos and short biographies of selected people including nice animations.

## Architecture

* Latest [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) 1.4.4
    * Bootstrapped with [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
    * [ng-route](https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.4/angular-route.js)
    * jqLite - subset of jQuery included with AngularJS
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) during development



### Technical choices

Although I have used Angular for a couple of months in my current job, I wanted to give developing an ngApp of my own a chance. The app demonstrates Angular's basic components.

To run with Angular was probably not the wisest of choices considering the time limit, as unfamiliarity with starting and setting up the project was time consuming. angular-seed naturally shortened the initial set-up time.

The project is hosted on [http://nlindroos.github.io/biogrid/app/index.html](http://nlindroos.github.io/biogrid/app/index.html).
