His creative curiosity and interest in technology developed as a youngster too, but it was only when he joined Nokia that he was able to bring together sport, creativity and technology through his award winning Push Snowboarding project, which was the starting point for a fruitful partnership between Nokia and Burton."

Sadly none of whom can cook a decent breakfast, which provided a practical role for me to fill on the trip too.\""

He quickly progressed to snow and, nurturing dreams of becoming professional, headed to the mountains when he left school. \"I had a little success before a knee injury put things in perspective\". Turning a negative into a positive, he used the recovery time to write for magazines, MC contests and dabble in television, which as it turned out he was better at than snowboarding."

But he will also concede that timing has played its part. The growth of the sports has allowed him to attend three Olympic Games, and Sochi will be his fourth. The massive exposure snowboarding in particular is receiving means it is more important than ever to set the right tone and this trip allowed Ed to explore his own and others ideas on how best to do that."
