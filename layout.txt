About me

My interests careerwise are combining (IT-related knowledge with managerial skills with a side of economics). I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering (http://cse.aalto.fi/en/) at Aalto University. I have included quite a lot of courses in Industrial Engineering and Management (http://tuta.aalto.fi/en/) in my studies, and I therefore have an understanding of the theoretical side of broader decision making in businesses. I have a dream to someday be able to combine these both of theses areas of knowledge in an exiting position.
